Overview
This server application provides a robust platform for managing the assignment of destinations to students efficiently. It leverages a genetic algorithm to optimize the assignment process, ensuring fairness and satisfaction among students. With support for multiple client connections, automatic disconnection handling, and dynamic destination assignment, this server offers a comprehensive solution for destination allocation tasks.

Features
Multi-client Support: The server is designed to handle multiple client connections concurrently, enabling seamless interaction with numerous students simultaneously.
Genetic Algorithm Integration: Utilizes a genetic algorithm to optimize the assignment of destinations based on students' preferences. This ensures an efficient and fair allocation process.
Automatic Disconnection Handling: Implements automatic disconnection handling for clients, ensuring graceful termination of connections upon submission or disconnection requests.
Dynamic Destination Assignment: Dynamically assigns destinations to students based on their preferences and availability, adapting to changing circumstances and preferences.
Real-time Updates: Provides real-time updates to clients regarding their assigned destinations, keeping them informed throughout the allocation process.
Scalability: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for easy expansion to accommodate a growing number of students and destinations without compromising performance.
Customization: Offers configuration options for port settings, client limits, and other parameters to tailor the server's behavior according to specific requirements.
Error Handling: Implements robust error handling mechanisms to address potential issues and ensure smooth operation under various conditions.
